### The first two methods weâ€™ll need:

 - The register will have a scan method that takes in a price, and records it.
 - The register will have a total method that shows the current total of all the prices that have been scanned so far.
 - If no prices have been scanned, the total should be zero.
 - The register will have a clear method that clears the register of all scanned items. The total should go back to zero again.
